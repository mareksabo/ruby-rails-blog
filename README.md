# Simple rails blogging application 

This application is a project to subject [PV249 Ruby](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2015PV249).

Here are some notes for teachers:

* Our app has only __6 models__, because we don't need more. We were thinking about Reply model, but making comments nested makes more sense.
